# Advent of Code

![Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/favicon.png)

This repository contains my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. **Advent of Code** is an online event where participants solve daily programming puzzles throughout December, designed to improve problem-solving and coding skills. I want to specify that 2024 is the first year I am participating, but I am taking this opportunity to learn new programming languages by solving the problems for this year and the previous years.

# Programming Languages Used

I use a variety of programming languages depending on the problem or for practice.

- **Python**: Primary language for rapid prototyping and solving.
- **C**: For performance-oriented solutions.
- **GO**: For performance-oriented solutions while preserving ease of use.
- **JavaScript**: For experimenting with algorithms in web-based environments.
- **TypeScript**: For a better JavaScript experience.
- **Rust**: For exploring efficient and safe system-level programming.
- **Java**: For exploring features that the language offers in a real world setting.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each directory corresponds to a specific year's challenge, and subdirectories contain solutions for individual days.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the appropriate interpreter or compiler installed for the language used:
  - Python: [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
  - C: GCC or another C compiler
  - JavaScript: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Rust: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

### Running a Solution

1. Navigate to the directory for the specific year and day:
   ```bash
   cd 2022/Day01
   ```
   
2. **Run the solution script or compile the code**:
   - Navigate to the specific year's directory and day:
     ```bash
     cd 2022/Day01
     ```
   - Run or compile the solution based on the programming language:
     - For **Python**:
       ```bash
       python solution.py
       ```
     - For **C**:
       ```bash
       gcc solution.c -o solution
       ./solution
       ```
     - For **JavaScript**:
       ```bash
       node solution.js
       ```
     - For **Rust**:
       ```bash
       cargo run
       ```
     - For **Java**:
       ```bash
       javac Solution.java
       java Solution
       ```

3. **Input Data**:
   - Input data is typically stored in a file named `input.txt` in the same directory.
   - Ensure the solution script reads from this file or follow instructions in the corresponding `README.md` of that day's solution.
